# Future Improvements

## Performance Optimizations

### Airport Data Loading
- **Issue**: API downloads and parses entire 83K+ airport CSV (several MB) every 24 hours, then filters to 3,046 airports
- **Impact**: Slow first request, unnecessary processing overhead, bandwidth usage
- **Solutions**:
  - Build-time preprocessing: Download CSV during build, generate static JSON of filtered airports
  - Database import: Load airports into proper database with indexing for location queries
  - CDN hosting: Pre-process data and serve filtered airports as static JSON
  - Persistent caching: Cache filtered results indefinitely, only refresh when dataset changes
  - Regional lazy loading: Only load airports for specific geographic regions as needed
